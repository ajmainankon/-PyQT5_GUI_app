[{"CVE": "Docker Socket Misconfiguration", "Description": "Since Docker containers execute commands as uid 0, a misconfigured Docker socket could allow unauthorized users to create containers with read/write permissions on the host’s ‘/’ path. This is done by taking advantage of the lack of authentication mechanisms on the default tcp socket, and mounting the root directory of the host inside of a container. It is then possible to escape out of it with the chroot command.", "CVSS": "N/A", "Link": "https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Docker_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html", "Script": "socketexploitfix.py"},{"CVE": "CVE-2018-15664", "Description": "In Docker through 18.06.1-ce-rc2, the API endpoints behind the 'docker cp' command are vulnerable to a symlink-exchange attack with Directory Traversal, giving attackers arbitrary read-write access to the host filesystem with root privileges, because daemon/archive.go does not do archive operations on a frozen filesystem (or from within a chroot).", "CVSS": 6.2, "Link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-15664/", "Script": "Not available"},{"CVE": "CVE-2019-5736", "Description": "Runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image, or (2) an existing container, to which the attacker previously had write access, that can be attached with docker exec.
